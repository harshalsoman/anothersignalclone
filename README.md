Yet Another Signal Clone

## Steps to Run the Signal application
### Server
First, you need to run the server with `python server.py`. This should be done by changing the directory to the `server`
folder

### Client
Next, you need to run at least 2 clients to get the end-to-end part working with `python client.py`. Again, this should
be done by changing the directory to `desktopclient` folder.
You need to checkout this code in 2 different folders or preferably on 2 different laptops.

Use the register user function to register yourself with the server, remember the credentials, you will need to enter
them on the login page. This should open the chat window which can be used for chatting.
